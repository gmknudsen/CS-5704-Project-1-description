# CS-5704-Project-1-description

This project refactored and extended the functionality of an existing RiverCrossing game application with a GUI. The code was first refactored to incorporate good, object-oriented programming practices, then extended to create other versions of the RiverCrossing game with different rules for the game based on the cast of characters. 

The end state functionality is similar to the functionality in these games: https://www.transum.org/software/River_Crossing/
